### Terminology: module vs. module package

*section 2:* This section shall explain the terminology *module*. Since the recent changes how papaya-package shall be organized. The given explaination is not correct.

***Proposal:*** *Modules* are files located in the directory representing a *module package* and are registered in the *module.xml* identified by a Global Universal Identifier (guid). It provides one aspect of the package's purpose. The community package, for instance, contains a file called content_login.php which is a standard login page, or box_login.php, a login box to be included into other pages.
