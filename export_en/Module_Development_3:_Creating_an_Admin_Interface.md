In this third part of the basic module development tutorial, we are going to create a custom backend administration interface for our module package. It will provide a convenient way to add, modify, and delete planets using the database access methods we implemented in the [previous part](/Module_Development_2:_Adding_Database_Support.md).

Please note that you should adhere to the [Papaya CMS Coding Standards](/Papaya_CMS_Coding_Standards.md), especially if you plan to contribute your modules for the papaya Community.
