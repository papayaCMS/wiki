Unfortunately, the english documentation has by far not yet reached the coverage
that the german documentation has. So if you speak at least a little German,
please have a look at the German links as well:

the following resources. This helps us to help you by spending less time
repeatedly answering questions answered elsewhere and concentrate on
developing the system. It also helps us conserve what little hair we have
remaining.

 1. Read the FAQ:           http://www.papaya-cms.com/faq/
 2. Read the docs:          http://www.papaya-cms.com/docs/

 4. Steps 1 - 3 didn't help?<br/>
   -> Write a message in our forum (http://www.papaya-cms.com/forum/)
      Please try to give as much information about your problem as
      possible (ie, operating system, version numbers etc).  This will
      not only help us to track down the problem, but also help those
      users with similar problems who come after you.
